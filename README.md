# BrainFlix
Full-stack React/Express.js video viewing app.

BrainFlix is a full-stack React App built with an Express.js backend. Users can click through a set of videos, view their meta information, and view the comments for that video. Photos are used in lieu of videos, as the main exercise of the project was to manage state and connect to your backend with read routes.
